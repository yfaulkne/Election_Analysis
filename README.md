## Challenge Summary
#### This script can be used to generate the outcome of almost any local election by candidate as well as county. With some modifications and more data, this script can further analyze and produce results for more counties if needed.
#### This script can also be modified, with more code, to breakdown a candidate's votes by county. That way the candidates can view how they were voted in each county represented.
